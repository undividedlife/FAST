Fortran Atmospheric Science Toolkit (FAST)

- Description
    - This toolkit includes various Fortran algorithms for use in atmospheric and geospace data analysis. The algorithms cover interpolation, curve fit, minimization (optimization), empirical orthogonal function analysis, singular value decomposition, spectral analysis, wavelet analysis, numerical integration, (vector) spherical harmonic expansion. This toolkit depends on various legacy Fortran codes developed for numerical computations. Many of the legacy codes are refactored using Fortran 2003 and 2008 standards.
